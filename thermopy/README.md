# thermopy: a thermodynamic package for general usage

## functions

Provided some commonly used thernodynamic chemical or thermodynamic constatnts of elements, compounds and mixtures. This will make development of thermodynamic softwares more convenient.


## Packages

### water

Provide proterties of water


### solution

Provide properties of different solutions.

vapor pressure of solutions:

- [x] NaCl-H2O
- [x] KCl-H2O
- [x] MgCl2-H2O
- [x] CaCl2-H2O


### solubility

Implemented solubilities of different electrolytes evaluated by B.S.Krumgalz (2017), some modifications have been made in polybomials to have better fit.
- [ ] NaCl-H2O
- [ ] KCl-H2O
- [x] MgCl2-H2O
- [ ] CaCl2-H2O
